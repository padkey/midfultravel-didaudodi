                                    After breakfast at the hotel, The Royal Grand Palace is the nation’s landmark and the most revered royal monument. You will see palaces that were used for different occasions – the Funeral Palace, the Reception Palace, the Throne Hall, the Coronation Hall, the Royal Guest House, and the mysterious Emerald Buddha which is most revered Buddha image in Thailand. Appropriate dress is required. (Note: Grand Palace is one of the most popular destinations and is usually a number one must-see place in Bangkok. Not surprisingly, it receives millions of tourists annually. To get the best of your visit and avoid crowds on spot we will allow your guide flexibility to visit the temple either early morning or late afternoon if possible in your itinerary. If you by any means decide that there are too many people for your liking, the guide can bring you to an alternative temple in the area such as Wat Saket or Wat Suthat, this decision needs to be made before entering the Grand Palace.) Continue your visit to Wat Pho, the home of Thai massage and the Reclining Buddha.

                                    This afternoon stroll through Chinatown where you visit interesting shops, tea shop, markets and temples to get a first-hand feel for old Bangkok. Continue to The Bangkok Folk Museum**, a seventy-year-old Thai house converted into a small but fascinating museum. Then hop on a long tail boat for a ride along the bustling Chao Phraya River and the quiet klongs (canals) of Thonburi where you see how Thai people have lived next to the water for centuries. Last stop is the magnificent Wat Arun or Temple of Dawn. (**Note: Bangkok Folk Museum is closed on Mondays & Tuesdays.)
